## About This Project
This project contains all my solutions about HackerRank problems. 

I started to solve problems in HackerRank several days ago. 
I will keep working on it and push the solutions here in time.

All solutions are C++ codes.

my HackerRank page: [CdiajadeX](https://www.hackerrank.com/CdiajadeX)

Feel free to star or fork this project. Thanks a lot.

## Suggestions
  * Think about the problem on your own first.
  * Only if you can't solve, you can take a look at the solution here. If the solution exists.
  * You can also contact me if you need some help.

## Explanation
I combined some friends to solve HackerRank problems and earn points to improve our rank in HackerRank.com. Since we just started to work on HackerRank problems, we don't have enough time to explain all the solutions. But if we have spare time, we will update our thoughts about problems in other projects. They are created based on HackerRank domains: 
  * [Algorithms](https://github.com/Hackerrank-coding/Algorithms)
  * [Math](https://github.com/Hackerrank-coding/Math)
  * and [Shell](https://github.com/Hackerrank-coding/Shell)

We just have these three catagories. We will add more if we have the energy to solve them.


## By the way
If you can't find the solutions or explanations but you found out that I already passed the problem, you can contact me. I will reply as soon as possible.
